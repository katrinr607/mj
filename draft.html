          Why did you have to compare me sa kuya ko? Alam ko, you didn't intend to do so â€” nadala ka lang din sa emotions mo and natrigger. Nakakasama ng loob. Deep down, iniisip ko â€” I donâ€™t even talk to him anymore, I held onto that, kaya baka kaya ko rin sayo??

          I was wrong. I saw the notification sa CODM. Iâ€™m not sure if it was tapped by accident, but my heart started racing. I donâ€™t even know if it was because I was confused or because I was happy kasi kahit hindi sadya, it still came from you.

          Out of sight, out of mind. Thatâ€™s what I keep telling myself. I blocked you so I wouldnâ€™t have to see you anymore. Itâ€™s hard pretending not to care or that Iâ€™m not interested. The truth is, I still check if you're checking on me too. Sa CODM, I intentionally kept your account doon. I told myself na Iâ€™d just wait for you to be the one to do it. And you still check my profile. Itâ€™s a mix of happiness and confusion, because somehow, you still check on me.

          I opened CODM and the first thing I checked was if you were online â€” and you were. I saw another notification from you, which made me think na the last one wasnâ€™t an accident after all. My heart started racing ulit. I panicked and exited sa app. I donâ€™t even understand why you're doing that, or why I feel this way.

          Iâ€™ve always known this, but I just keep getting reminded kapag nangyari na â€” itâ€™s so easy to say things we donâ€™t fully mean when weâ€™re at the peak of our emotions. It sucks that we ended up hurting each other like that. Iâ€™m really sorry. I canâ€™t stay mad at you. Iâ€™ve forgotten what that anger and frustration felt like. I just miss you so much.

          And you did remove me. I expected it â€” and I know I shouldnâ€™t let it get to me, but it still did. The what ifs keep lingering in my head. What if, dahil I didnâ€™t react sa notification, you thought I didnâ€™t care anymore? I did care. I still do.

          I only managed to fall asleep by morning. Pero kahit ganon, I kept waking up. And each time I did, I prayed. I asked God to give us a moment â€” kahit isa lang para mag usap ulit. Not to force anything, not to beg, but simply to talk.

          Iâ€™m yearning. Let it be me, let it be youâ€¦ let it be us once again. Only God knows how many times Iâ€™ve mentioned your name in my prayers. And every time, itâ€™s with a quiet hope. Alam ko, all of this happened for a reason. Weâ€™ve been through A LOT, I just know na Heâ€™s listening, kaya baka Heâ€™ll make a way.

          I just wish I still matter to you. That somehow, ako pa rin. And kahit hindi naâ€¦ I hope, in time, I get to be that someone ulit. Sabi mo nga, when the timing is kinder to the both of us. At kung sakaling, pwede pa.

          I know youâ€™re probably taking this time to heal too, and the last thing I want is to disturb your peace. Still, Iâ€™d be lying if I said I wasnâ€™t scared â€” scared na if wala akong ginawa, you might fully move on from me. But like what I said, I believe that love and feelings canâ€™t be forced. So baka the right thing to do now is to wait, to give you the space you need, kahit na sobrang hirap and walang kasiguraduhan because of how we ended. Youâ€™re not responsible for me or for what I feel. You have every right to replace me or choose someone else, if thatâ€™s where your heart leads you. All I can do for now is quietly hope that somehow, we still find our way back to each other.

          Yay, I was right. The timing felt right. Every time I set my account to private, you do the same shortly after. Iâ€™m assuming na you probably check my account muna, then decided to go private. I know it might sound a little absurd, and Iâ€™m sorry if it does, but stilllll, I guess my theory makes sense in a way, di ba?

          Alam mo ba? Iâ€™m having nightmares na naman. Itâ€™s like I canâ€™t let myself fall asleep nang maaga kasi every time I try, I end up waking nang madaling araw with my heart racing. It happened again tonight. I really wish I could tell you this rn, I miss you.
