          Why did you have to compare me sa kuya ko? Nakakagalit. Nakakasama ng loob. Deep down, iniisip ko — I don’t even talk to him anymore, I held onto that, kaya baka kaya ko rin sayo??

          I was wrong.
          I saw the notification sa CODM. I’m not sure if it was tapped by accident, but my heart started racing. I don’t even know if it was because I was confused or because I was happy kasi kahit hindi sadya, it still came from you.

          Out of sight, out of mind.
          That’s what I keep telling myself. I blocked you so I wouldn’t have to see you anymore. It’s hard pretending not to care or that I’m not interested. The truth is, I still check if you're checking on me too. Sa CODM, I intentionally kept your account doon. I told myself na I’d just wait for you to be the one to do it. And you still check my profile. It’s a mix of happiness and confusion, because somehow, you still check on me.

          I opened CODM and the first thing I checked was if you were online — and you were. I saw another notification from you, which made me think na the last one wasn’t an accident after all. My heart started racing ulit. I panicked and exited sa app. I don’t even understand why you're doing that, or why I feel this way.

          Maybe you won’t read this.  
          But if you do...  
          I never stopped hoping you'd come back.
